Complexity Analysis


What is Algorithm: A finite sequence of instructions
 - No ambiguity, and each step precisely defined
 - Should work for all (well-formed) input
 - Should finish in a finite (reasonable) amount of time


Problem Solving Steps
 - Understand the Problem
 - Decide on the computational means (sequential/parallel, exact/approximate)
 - Decide on method to use (algorithm design technique or strategy, use of randomization)
 - Design the necessary data structures and algorithm
 - Check for correctness, trace example input
 - Evaluate analytically (time, space, worst case, average case)
 - Code it
 - Evaluate empirically
